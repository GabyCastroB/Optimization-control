# ⚙️ Optimization and Control

This repository contains a collection of projects and laboratory exercises developed for the course **Optimization and Control**, focused on consensus algorithms, distributed systems, and unconstrained optimization methods.  
The goal of this repository is to explore the theoretical and practical aspects of optimization techniques applied to **multi-agent systems** and **control engineering** problems.

## 📘 Overview

The projects in this repository demonstrate how **optimization and control theories** are implemented using Python and MATLAB.  
Each lab explores a different aspect of distributed optimization and dynamic consensus, emphasizing both **mathematical formulation** and **simulation results**.

Through these exercises, the following skills were developed:

- Analysis and simulation of **consensus protocols** for multi-agent systems.  
- Implementation of **distributed optimization algorithms**.  
- Exploration of **gradient-based** and **unconstrained optimization** methods.  
- Visualization of **convergence, stability, and error behavior** in control systems.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

### 🔹 Consensus Algorithms
Consensus protocols are essential for coordination in distributed systems.  
These algorithms allow multiple agents to reach a **common agreement** through **local interactions**.

### 🔹 Optimization-Based Control
Explores the use of optimization methods — such as **Gradient Descent** and **Newton’s Method** — to achieve **stable** and **optimal system performance**.

### 🔹 Distributed Optimization
Implements **consensus-based optimization** techniques that allow agents to solve global optimization problems using only **local information** and **neighbor communication**.
