# 🤖 Distributed Consensus for Navigation and Obstacle Avoidance in Mobile Robots

This repository presents the implementation of a **distributed consensus system** for the coordination of multiple mobile robots navigating in a known environment.  
The project was developed as part of the course **Optimization and Control** at the **National University of Colombia**.

Through **local interaction rules**, the robots adjust their trajectories based on neighbor information to reach a **common target point** — ensuring smooth movement and **collision avoidance** without a centralized controller.

## 📘 Abstract

This work implements a distributed consensus control algorithm that enables multiple mobile robots to coordinate their movements while avoiding obstacles.  
The system integrates **differential kinematics** and **consensus-based navigation**, where each robot makes decisions based on its **local neighborhood** instead of relying on a central planner.

The combination of consensus dynamics and obstacle avoidance ensures that:
- All agents converge to a shared goal.  
- Movements are smooth and physically feasible.  
- Collisions are avoided through **repulsive potential functions**.

**Keywords:** consensus, navigation, multi-agent systems, differential kinematics, collision avoidance.

## ⚙️ Project Overview

The simulation demonstrates how four mobile robots reach a consensus point using **distributed control**.  
Each robot:
1. Calculates the local average position of its neighbors.  
2. Moves toward the consensus direction while respecting differential kinematics.  
3. Avoids obstacles through repulsive forces.  
4. Stops when reaching the consensus region.

The algorithm was implemented in **MATLAB**, simulating agent behavior within a **20×20** grid.

## 🧠 Simulations and Results

### 🧩 Scenario
- **Grid size:** 20×20  
- **Agents:** 4  
- **Obstacles:** Circular, defined by center coordinates and radius
